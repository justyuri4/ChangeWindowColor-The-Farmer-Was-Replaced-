This is essential for players who spend significant time coding and want a personalized, comfortable, and productive work environment.

<h3>Key Features:</h3>
Dynamic UI Control: The mod adds a toggle button to easily show or hide the configuration panel.
Real-time Color Sliders (RGB): Use three individual sliders to adjust the Red, Green, and Blue components of the window's main color. Changes are applied instantly, allowing you to fine-tune your desired shade immediately.
